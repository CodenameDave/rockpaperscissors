Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors

I have given up on my calculator for now as it appears I haven't found the best way to do it. This project is withen my scope and will still challenge me enough at this stage.

Starting scope:
-Player vs Computer
-Best of 3
-show all selections under player name

2nd Scope
-two player mode (maybe an option to choose)
-hide selction from other player
